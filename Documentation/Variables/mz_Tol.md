## Description

mz_Tol` is a numerical value that defines the tolerance for m/z values, used in `ms2_SpectralRedundancy`, `AdjacencyList_mz`, `AdjacencyListFeatures`, `Features_ms2_SamplesAligment`, and `ms2_SpectralSimilarityClustering` to determine which features are considered neighbors based on their m/z proximity.
