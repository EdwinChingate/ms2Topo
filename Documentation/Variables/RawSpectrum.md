## Description

RawSpectrum` is a NumPy array containing raw spectral data (m/z and intensities). It is used in multiple functions (`ms2Peak`, `ms2Peak_contribution`, `WriteLog`, `Find_ms2Peak`, `ms2_peak_stats`, `PlotSpec`, `ms2_peakStats_safe`, `ms2_spectrum`) to find, refine, calculate statistics, and log data, as well as for plotting and peak detection.
