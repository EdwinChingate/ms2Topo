## Description

NPeaks_std_cut` is an integer that represents the number of peaks to keep based on the cumulative standard deviation, used by `NPeaksRestrict` to determine the cutoff, and by `RawParametersCut` to truncate a set of parameters. This helps to reduce the number of peaks based on their standard deviations.
