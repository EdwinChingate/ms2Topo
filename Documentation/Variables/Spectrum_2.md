## Description

Spectrum_2` is a NumPy array holding a mass spectrum, used in `GoodNeigbour` to evaluate if two spectra are neighbors, in `OverlpaingPeaks` to identify overlapping peaks with `Spectrum_1`, in `AlignSpectra` to align two spectra, and in `Similarity_2Spectra` and `Cosine_2Spectra` to calculate spectral similarity.
