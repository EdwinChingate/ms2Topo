## Description

PeakData` is a numpy array of floats that contains data points of a peak, such as m/z and intensity (or RT and intensity), used by `mz_Gauss_std`, `Find_ms2Peak`, `RT_Gauss_std`, and `r2_Gauss` to calculate the standard deviations, to filter peaks, and to determine the goodness of fit when modeling the peak with a Gaussian curve.
