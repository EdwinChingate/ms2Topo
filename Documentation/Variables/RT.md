## Description

RT` represents a retention time, which is an important parameter in chromatographic analysis. It's used to find the closest ms1 spectrum in `closest_ms1_spec`, to calculate the gaussian shape in `ChromGaussPeak` and as a centroid for the gaussian fit in `WeightGauss`, and the center for calculating the gaussian peak in `PeakChromGauss`.
